# Implement Obsidian Sync Feature

- [ ] Implement Obsidian Sync Feature

## Description

Create a comprehensive bidirectional sync system between TaskMaster and Obsidian vaults. This feature will allow users to maintain their tasks in both systems seamlessly.

## Implementation Details

The sync system should:

1. **Parse Obsidian markdown files** to extract task information
2. **Generate TaskMaster-compatible JSON** from Obsidian tasks
3. **Create Obsidian markdown files** from TaskMaster tasks
4. **Handle conflicts** when tasks are modified in both systems
5. **Maintain metadata** such as tags, priorities, and timestamps

## Technical Requirements

- Support for YAML frontmatter parsing
- Regex-based task extraction from markdown content
- File system operations with proper error handling
- Conflict detection and resolution strategies
- Performance optimization for large vaults

## Test Strategy

- Unit tests for all parser functions
- Integration tests for complete sync workflows  
- End-to-end tests with real Obsidian vaults
- Performance tests with large datasets
- Edge case testing for malformed content

## Dependencies

- [[Setup Development Environment]]
- [[Configure Testing Framework]]
- [[Design Data Models]]
