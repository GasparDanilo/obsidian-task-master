# Obsidian TaskMaster Integration Guide

‚ú® **Successfully Tested Installation Guide** - Updated with real-world results from vault integration

A comprehensive step-by-step guide for using the Obsidian integration features in TaskMaster, based on successful testing with an Obsidian vault containing 1,465+ tasks.

## Overview

This TaskMaster fork adds powerful integration with Obsidian vaults, enabling **bidirectional synchronization** between your TaskMaster database and Obsidian markdown files. You can manage tasks in either system and keep them synchronized.

### ‚úÖ Proven Results
- **93 TaskMaster tasks** successfully synced to individual markdown files
- **Perfect YAML frontmatter** generation with task metadata
- **Seamless integration** with existing vault content (1,372 existing tasks preserved)
- **Real-time sync status** monitoring and conflict detection

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** installed on your system
2. **An existing Obsidian vault** with markdown files
3. **TaskMaster project** cloned and set up

## Initial Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all required packages for TaskMaster and the Obsidian integration.

### 2. Verify Installation

Check that the Obsidian commands are available:

```bash
node scripts/dev.js --help
```

You should see these additional commands:
- `obsidian-init` - Initialize Obsidian vault integration
- `obsidian-sync` - Sync tasks between TaskMaster and Obsidian
- `obsidian-status` - Check sync status and statistics

## Setting Up Vault Integration

### 3. Initialize Obsidian Integration

```bash
node scripts/dev.js obsidian-init --vault "C:\path\to\your\obsidian\vault"
```

**Example:**
```bash
node scripts/dev.js obsidian-init --vault "C:\Users\User\Desktop\Testing\vault-main"
```

This command will:
- Create a `Tasks` directory in your vault for TaskMaster-generated files
- Create a `Tags` directory for tag management
- Generate a `TaskMaster-README.md` file with usage instructions
- Create a `.taskmaster-sync.json` configuration file

**Success indicators:**
- No error messages
- New directories and files created in your vault
- Confirmation message about successful initialization

## Syncing Tasks from TaskMaster to Obsidian

### 4. Preview Sync (Dry Run)

Before making changes, always preview what will happen:

```bash
node scripts/dev.js obsidian-sync --to-obsidian --vault "C:\path\to\your\vault" --dry-run
```

**Example output:**
```
DRY RUN: Would create 93 markdown files in vault Tasks directory
```

### 5. Perform Actual Sync

Once satisfied with the preview:

```bash
node scripts/dev.js obsidian-sync --to-obsidian --vault "C:\path\to\your\vault"
```

This creates individual markdown files for each TaskMaster task with:
- YAML frontmatter containing task metadata
- Task title as heading
- Description and notes
- Checkbox reflecting task status (`- [ ]` for pending, `- [x]` for completed)

**Generated file structure:**
```markdown
---
id: "67"
title: "Task Title"
status: "pending"
priority: "medium"
created: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---

# Task Title

- [ ] Task Title

## Description
Task description here...

## Notes
Task notes here...
```

## Making Manual Edits in Obsidian

### 6. Edit Tasks in Obsidian

You can manually edit any TaskMaster-generated file:

1. Open the task file in Obsidian (located in `Tasks/` directory)
2. Modify the status in frontmatter (`pending` ‚Üí `in-progress` ‚Üí `completed`)
3. Change the checkbox (`- [ ]` ‚Üí `- [x]`)
4. Add notes, modify description, or update other fields
5. Save the file

**Example edit:**
```markdown
---
status: "in-progress"  # Changed from "pending"
---

# Task Title

- [x] Task Title  # Changed checkbox

## Manual Notes
Added some progress notes here...
```

## Syncing Changes from Obsidian to TaskMaster

### 7. Preview Obsidian to TaskMaster Sync

Check what changes would be imported:

```bash
node scripts/dev.js obsidian-sync --from-obsidian --vault "C:\path\to\your\vault" --dry-run
```

This shows:
- How many new tasks would be created from Obsidian files
- Which TaskMaster tasks would be updated
- Summary of changes

### 8. Apply Changes from Obsidian

```bash
node scripts/dev.js obsidian-sync --from-obsidian --vault "C:\path\to\your\vault"
```

This imports:
- Manual edits made to TaskMaster-generated files
- New tasks created directly in Obsidian (following the correct format)
- Updates to existing task statuses, priorities, and content

## Bidirectional Synchronization

### 9. Full Bidirectional Sync (Preview)

```bash
node scripts/dev.js obsidian-sync --bidirectional --vault "C:\path\to\your\vault" --dry-run
```

This shows what would happen in both directions:
- Tasks from TaskMaster ‚Üí Obsidian
- Tasks from Obsidian ‚Üí TaskMaster
- Updates in both directions

### 10. Perform Bidirectional Sync

```bash
node scripts/dev.js obsidian-sync --bidirectional --vault "C:\path\to\your\vault"
```

This ensures both systems are fully synchronized.

## Monitoring and Status Checking

### 11. Check Sync Status

```bash
node scripts/dev.js obsidian-status --vault "C:\path\to\your\vault"
```

**Example output:**
```
=== TaskMaster ‚Üî Obsidian Sync Status ===

TaskMaster Tasks: 93
Obsidian Tasks Found: 1,465

Tasks in TaskMaster but missing in Obsidian: 0
Tasks in Obsidian but missing in TaskMaster: 1,372

Recommendation: Run 'obsidian-sync --from-obsidian' to import Obsidian tasks
```

This helps you understand:
- How many tasks exist in each system
- Which tasks are missing from either side
- Synchronization recommendations

### 12. Verify Individual Tasks

Check specific tasks to confirm sync worked:

```bash
node index.js list --id 67
```

Compare with the corresponding Obsidian file to ensure changes were applied correctly.

## Best Practices

### Workflow Recommendations

1. **Always use dry-run first** - Preview changes before applying them
2. **Regular status checks** - Use `obsidian-status` to monitor synchronization
3. **Incremental syncing** - Sync regularly rather than letting changes accumulate
4. **Backup before major syncs** - Especially when importing many tasks from Obsidian

### File Management

1. **Use the Tasks directory** - Keep TaskMaster-generated files in `/Tasks/`
2. **Follow the format** - When creating tasks directly in Obsidian, use the same YAML frontmatter structure
3. **Tag consistency** - Use consistent tag naming between systems

### Troubleshooting

1. **Check file permissions** - Ensure TaskMaster can read/write to your vault
2. **Verify vault path** - Double-check the path to your Obsidian vault
3. **Review error messages** - Most issues are reported with clear error messages
4. **Use dry-run mode** - Test operations without making changes when troubleshooting

2. **Initial sync:** `node scripts/dev.js obsidian-sync --to-obsidian --vault "C:\Users\User\Desktop\Testing\vault-main" --dry-run`
3. **Execute sync:** `node scripts/dev.js obsidian-sync --to-obsidian --vault "C:\Users\User\Desktop\Testing\vault-main"`
4. **Make edits in Obsidian:** Edit task files manually
5. **Preview import:** `node scripts/dev.js obsidian-sync --from-obsidian --vault "C:\Users\User\Desktop\Testing\vault-main" --dry-run`
6. **Import changes:** `node scripts/dev.js obsidian-sync --from-obsidian --vault "C:\Users\User\Desktop\Testing\vault-main"`
